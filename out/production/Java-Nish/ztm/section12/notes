Recursion : A function that refers to itself.
Tasks that have repeated subtasks.

Stack overflow ->
Maximum call stack size exceeded.
When you are calling a function recursively over and over again without breaking the chain.

If we keep pushing functions to stack without any pop we might end up with stack overflow.

Every recursive function needs to have a base case.

1. Identify base case
2. Identify recursive case
3. Usually you have 2 returns, One for base case and another for recursive case.

Tail Call Optimization :
Large call stack issue can be resolved with the help of tail call optimization.
