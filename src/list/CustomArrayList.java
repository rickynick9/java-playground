/*
As elements are added to an ArrayList, its capacity grows automatically.

An application can increase the capacity of an ArrayList instance before adding a large number of elements
using the ensureCapacity operation. This may reduce the amount of incremental reallocation.

The iterators returned by this class's iterator and listIterator methods are fail-fast: if the list is structurally
modified at any time after the iterator is created, in any way except through the iterator's own remove or add methods,
the iterator will throw a ConcurrentModificationException.
