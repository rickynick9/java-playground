We want to have generic items in priority queue that are comparable.
Challenge : Find largest M items in a stream of N items.
    Fraud Detection : Isolate $$ transactions


Unordered Max Priority Queue
Insertion takes O(1)
Delete max takes O(n) - we have to go through the entire array to find max element
Find Max O(n)

Goal : log(n) complexity for all operations
